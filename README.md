# Multiplication-Game
Now a days most of our develpoment mainly for those who want their business grown up. But for the first time we've developed an application for the children. The developed application is "Multiplication Game." We've chosen java platform to develop this application. Many childern forgot multiplication. But they know to operate devices like mobile phone, computers etc. Our development is for those childern. It needs more development so that it will be more easy to operate, understand and become user friendly. We're trying to get creative idea for this development, so that the development can achieve its goal. Hope you will like this.
